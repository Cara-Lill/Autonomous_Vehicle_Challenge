# Autonomous Vehicle Challenge

The goal of the AVC project was to build a robot, developing both hardware and software, capable of navigating a four-part obstacle course. The course consisting of the following:

1. Remotely opening a gate
2. Following curved lines
3. Navigating a maze
4. Interating with different coloured/shaped objects in different ways

## Overview

The project involves developing an Autonomous Vehicle Challenge (AVC) robot designed to navigate a four-quadrant course. The robot was created to operate independently, with its software and hardware working in tandem to overcome various obstacles, such as connecting to a server to open a gate, following a curved line, navigating a maze, and interacting with colored cylinders and a ball. The project aimed to create a robust and efficient robot that could complete the course with minimal human interference.

My team's efforts included extensive research, design, and testing to ensure the robot's functionality. The hardware, based on a Raspberry Pi, included servo motors, a camera, and custom parts produced using a 3D printer. The software, written in C++, enabled the robot to process visual inputs and make real-time adjustments. The project provided valuable experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and the practical application of engineering principles, ultimately achieving a nearly perfect run with only minor issues.

## Note

Running this project on your own will be challenging because the code in this repository is incomplete. It relies on functions provided by the University, which I have excluded from the repository.
